# meeting 3:
we have  a very niche customer base 

chandu - you should decide the forms to be allocated to each member and relay the dates on which everything will be done by. so do it

you are the single point of contact for each member for their queeries adn stuff with the project manager (monish rana)

so you are responsible for everyone's work
